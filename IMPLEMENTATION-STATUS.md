# Course-Based RAG System - Implementation Status

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective: COMPLETED âœ…
Successfully implemented course-based VTT upload and access control system for ChaiCode-Courses-RAG-B backend.

## âœ… All Features Implemented

### 1. Database Architecture
- âœ… Course model with comprehensive metadata
- âœ… UserCourse junction table for many-to-many relationships  
- âœ… Database migrations successfully executed
- âœ… Model associations properly configured

### 2. Course Management APIs
- âœ… `POST /api/course/courses` - Create course (admin only)
- âœ… `GET /api/course/courses` - List courses with pagination/filtering
- âœ… `PUT /api/course/courses/:id` - Update course (admin only)
- âœ… `DELETE /api/course/courses/:id` - Soft delete course (admin only)

### 3. User Access Management
- âœ… `POST /api/course/grant-access` - Grant course access (admin only)
- âœ… `POST /api/course/revoke-access` - Revoke course access (admin only)
- âœ… `GET /api/course/user-courses` - Get user's accessible courses

### 4. Enhanced Vector Storage
- âœ… Qdrant "course_vectors" collection with course payload filtering
- âœ… VTT upload API updated to associate files with specific courses
- âœ… Vector search filtering by user's accessible courses

### 5. Security & Access Control
- âœ… Admin-only restrictions for course creation and VTT uploads
- âœ… Course access validation in askQuestion API
- âœ… JWT-based authentication with role-based permissions

## ðŸš€ System Status
- **Server**: Running successfully on http://localhost:5000
- **Database**: All tables created and synchronized
- **API Endpoints**: All routes functional and tested
- **Authentication**: Working with proper role-based access control

## ðŸ“‹ Key API Endpoints

### Course Management
```
POST   /api/course/courses          # Create course (admin)
GET    /api/course/courses          # List courses
PUT    /api/course/courses/:id      # Update course (admin)
DELETE /api/course/courses/:id      # Delete course (admin)
```

### Access Management  
```
POST   /api/course/grant-access     # Grant course access (admin)
POST   /api/course/revoke-access    # Revoke course access (admin)
GET    /api/course/user-courses     # Get user courses
```

### VTT & RAG
```
POST   /api/course/upload-vtt       # Upload VTT files to course (admin)
POST   /api/course/ask              # Ask questions (filtered by course access)
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Database Tables
- `Courses` - Course metadata and statistics
- `UserCourses` - User-course access relationships
- `users` - Enhanced with role-based permissions

### Vector Storage
- Single Qdrant collection: "course_vectors"
- Payload includes: course_id, topic, title, section, file
- Query filtering by user's accessible course IDs

### Security Features
- Admin-only course creation and VTT uploads
- User course access validation
- JWT authentication with role verification
- Automatic course access filtering in vector queries

## âœ… All Requirements Met
1. âœ… Course-based VTT upload restricted to admins
2. âœ… VTT files associated with specific courses
3. âœ… Qdrant storage with course payload filtering
4. âœ… Many-to-many user-course relationships
5. âœ… askQuestion API filters by user's course access
6. âœ… Complete admin course management system

**Status: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** ðŸŽ‰
